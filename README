CreateOrUpdateBy
================

This plugin mimicks something like MySQL REPLACE INTO mechanism, in which you
can specify a primary key, and depending on whether a record exists already, it
will be replaced or newly created.

This plugin does the same, but allows not only primary keys to be specified as search
conditions, but ANY column, or ANY two columns.

Idea for extension to include two find parameters / conditions (found via Google):

Tests, pluginization and documentation: me.
